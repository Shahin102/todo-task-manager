# Running the API Locally to test it with Postman

Download the XAMPP Control Panel â†’

https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

Note: if you have a MySQL community server downloaded in your local machine then itâ€™s ok - you just have to make sure itâ€™s running (youâ€™ll have to deal with MySQL Workbench instead of phpMyAdmin about which Iâ€™m going to talk below)

Then Start the Modules (1. Apache and 2. MySQL) then click on Admin next to MySQL - itâ€™ll take you to the interface of phpMyAdmin which is the administrative tool for MySQL server in where youâ€™ll see the Database and Tables which will make by all of your CRUD operations throughout the process of making the HTTP requests with the postman.

Note: if youâ€™ve installed MySQL Community Server then your MySQL-Module will not Start thatâ€™s why you have to Stop your MySQL server to run the server with the XAMPP

To do so â†’ go to Services -- and then Stop the MySQL server

Now, Fork (or clone) the repository from

https://github.com/Shahin102/node-sql-mysql-jwt-authentication-rest-api

to your GitHub and then clone it to your code editor then in your terminal run the command â†’

             npm install     (itâ€™ll install the dependencies)

             node index.js     (itâ€™ll start running the appâ€™s server)

Note: you can use â†’ nodemon index.js (instead of â†’ node index.js) to run the server

install nodemon :

             npm install --g nodemon

We use nodemon so that we don't need to reconnect our server while making any change in node.js, it'll automatically reconnect our server (itâ€™ll save our time while developing ðŸ˜€)

Now, inside of phpMyadmin we'll create the app's database called todotaskmanager.

Then we can run the app with having the record in database.
